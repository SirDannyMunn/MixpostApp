  "description": "ArcAds.AI is an AI-powered video advertising platform that enables marketers to rapidly generate, localize, and test UGC-style video ads using hyper-realistic AI avatars, reducing production cost and increasing creative velocity. This project must be built as a Laravel package located at C:\\laragon\\www\\MixpostApp\\packages\\video-gen and is entirely backend-driven with no UI required at this stage. All application state, internal Laravel functions, database access, environment variables, and convenience tests should be handled through the Tinker debug library (C:\\laragon\\www\\MixpostApp\\packages\\tinker-debug\\README.md) for ad-hoc code execution and debugging. All env variables are already set in the main app .env file and are available inside the application As well as somewhere to store the profile or page ID in which to post to.",
