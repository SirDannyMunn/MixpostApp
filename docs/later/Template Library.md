Below is a **complete, production-ready template set** that covers:

* Funnel Stages

* Intent Types
  Educational / Persuasive / Story / Contrarian

* Platforms
  LinkedIn / X (Twitter)

Each template includes:

* when to use

# 🧩 HOW YOUR SYSTEM USES THESE

🚦 Selection logic should be rule-driven:

```
Funnel = TOF
Intent = Educational
Platform = LinkedIn
→ TEMPLATE: TOF Educational LinkedIn Authority
```

or:

```
Funnel = MOF
Intent = Story
Platform = Any
→ TEMPLATE: MOF Founder Story
```

or:

```
Funnel = BOF
Intent = Persuasive
→ TEMPLATE: Offer or Case Study depending on context match
```

Templates are **structure + behavior discipline**.
Swipe structures enhance tone and execution.
Knowledge → fills the content meaningfully.
