#   Noisy   Document   Title   

---

This   document	contains   inconsistent   spacing,  broken   lists, and   heavy   Markdown.

## Key Points (broken)
 -First item without a space
 - Second   item with extra   spaces
 -   Third item

### Header with trailing hashes ###

> Quote with   extra   spaces

Code:
```
function  add(a,  b){return a+ b}
```

Conclusion: The underlying meaning should remain intact even when formatting is irregular or noisy. Normalization should preserve semantics and remove irrelevant tokens.
