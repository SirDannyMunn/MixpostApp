Remote work increases productivity and employee satisfaction by reducing commute time and enabling deep work without office interruptions. Teams that adopt asynchronous collaboration and clear documentation often see faster cycle times and fewer meetings.

However, remote work can also reduce spontaneous collaboration and weaken cross-team visibility. Without deliberate rituals and shared working hours, misalignment grows, onboarding takes longer, and knowledge silos form, hurting product quality over time.
