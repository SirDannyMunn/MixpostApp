Pamela believes intentional culture creation is a key differentiator for startups and fast-growing organizations. With AI becoming more and more sophisticated, emotional intelligence and human-centered leadership have to evolve to match this sophistication. Top performers want to be in cultures where they can be their authentic selves, create, and grow their craft. They want to be better at what they do, and as human beings, they have choices and very little tolerance for top-down incongruent organizations. The acceleration of remote and multigenerational workforces also means that the ability to connect and inspire is essential to execution. Leveraging her expertise in startup cultures and extensive experience in organizational development, Pamela helps executives and their organizations close the gap between who they declare themselves to be and who they truly are. High performance can be human-centered. \n\nPamela graduated Magna Cum Laude with\u00a0degrees in Psychology and Business Management. She has a Master\u2019s degree in Human Development and a Ph.D. in Organizational Development and Change. Pamela received her professional coach\u00a0training from the Coaches Training Institute in San\u00a0Francisco, California, and is a proud graduate of\u00a0their intensive Leadership program.
